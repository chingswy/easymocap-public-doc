    <div> Given sparse multi-view videos of human performers, our approach is able to generate high-fidelity novel views and accurate instance masks even for crowded scenes. This scene is captured by 8 GoPro cameras.</div>

<!-- ## Failure Cases

Consider the technical components of our work, we may fail in such cases: -->

## Limitations and future work

Currently, the proposed approach is limited to the setting of multiple human performers, only balls as objects, a simple background and a calibrated camera array. As future work, the system can be enhanced in several ways to handle more general settings. 

1. Recovering the human interaction from moving cameras or even a monocular video can be further investigated. 
2. More general objects can be handled by tracking the 6DoF
poses with object pose trackers. 
3. If offline scanning of the background is available, the rendering quality of the background can be further improved.
